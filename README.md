# BBox-Visualizer2

This is a python package for visualizing bounding boxes and adding labels to a given image. The creation of this package is inspired by [shoumikchow/bbox-visualizer](https://github.com/shoumikchow/bbox-visualizer), but I re-implement it through `Pillow` instead of `cv2`.

The format of a bounding box is `(xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)`.
