This is a python package for visualizing bounding boxes and adding labels to a given image.
The creation of this package is inspired 
by [shoumikchow/bbox-visualizer](https://github.com/shoumikchow/bbox-visualizer), 
but I re-implement it through `Pillow` instead of `cv2`.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guides.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
